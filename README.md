# Pygame Tutorial 

You probably play (or have played) video games. Chances are you have also had some good video game ideas that you would love to see as an actual, playable video game. Believe it or not, you can create a fun video game with just a few images and like 300 lines of code.

## Visual Studio Code
We are going to use an application called [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/) to write the 300 lines of code for the game. It is a IDE created by Microsoft and has many nice features, like syntax highlighting and auto-completion (called IntelliSense).

## Game genre
The type of game we will be creating will be a game very much like the game *Space Invaders*, created in 1978. If you played it it would probably seem really hard and boring, but if you make your own version you will like it more, it will be easier for you, and you will get an excuse to play video games all day long! Just call it 'Quality Assurance Testing'

## Have fun creating your game :computer: :video_game:
