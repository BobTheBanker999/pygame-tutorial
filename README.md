# Pygame Tutorial 

You probably play (or have played) video games. Chances are you have also had some good video game ideas that you would love to see as an actual, playable video game. But you are not a software company with billions of dollars. Believe it or not, you can create a fun video game with just a few images and like 300 lines of code.

## Visual Studio Code
We are going to use an application called [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/) to write the 300 lines of code for the game. It is a IDE created by Microsoft and has many nice features, like syntax highlighting and auto-completion (called IntelliSense).

## Have fun creating your game :computer: :video_game:
